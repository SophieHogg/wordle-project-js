# Orchid Wordle - Javascript Wordle Project

A Wordle game in the browser made using Javascript.

This game is based on the NYT Wordle game. I initially made this game as a Java console application as part of my time at \_nology, but decided to revamp it into a full browser application.

I got help from this FreeCodeCamp article: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-wordle-clone-in-javascript/ and of course took reference from the NYT Wordle game (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

## Style and Design

I decided to have this project stick with the colour theme of my \_nology project suite - using the colours of Australian flora. In this case, I selected the national emblem of Queensland, the Cooktown Orchid. This means lots of purples and greens.

## Responsiveness

I aim for this browser application to be available down to very narrow widths, so that it can be played on web browsers even on mobile devices.

## Aims and the MVP

-   Create a Wordle application
-   Randomly select a word from a predefined list
-   User gets 6 guesses
-   User receives feedback on the validity and accuracy of their guesses, and how many guesses they have had
-   If/when the user succeeds:
    -   Return a response of what the word is and the number of guesses
-   If/when the user fails:
    -   Return a response of what the word is

### Extensions

-   Display the word in another language or its etymology (in the Java project, I displayed the word in German.)
-   Display a complete grid of guesses when the word is guessed, potentially with emojis
-   Dark mode
-   Eventually, I hope to recreate this as a mobile app (likely with Kotlin, as I have an Android device.)
